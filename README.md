# Overview

brewcase allows for building and distributing a self-contained packaging of Homebrew-built binaries, including basic support managing configuration files.

This is pretty alpha stuff, and mostly has been made to make it slightly easier to install the KeckCAVES software on a Mac.  Using Homebrew directly is quite nice, but too often there were people who ran into issues because of having various libraries already installed from various other methods of installing programs.

Hopefully this doesn't just add to the melee.

This issue also may be better handled by creating Homebrew bottles for all needed packages.

Anyway, if you think you'd like to give it a try for your own set of Homebrew programs, please do!  It would be interesting to see if this is more generally useful than for just the KeckCAVES software.  Plus, there was some effort put into trying to make it flexible enough to do just that.
